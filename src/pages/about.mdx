# <AnimatedText>About.</AnimatedText>

I’m a bit of a jack of all trade. I’ve been mixing between graphical
design and programming since I was a teenager. Even though I love UX/UI
design, I’m most passionate about programming. Both on the frontend and
backend. I prefer functional programming, and Javascript is my language
of choice, but I love the opportunity to work with other functional
languages.

Most of my projects are available on [Github](https://github.com/antonstrand). If you want the good stuff directly, you can visit [tasktracker.se](https://tasktracker.se/project/5b14049c1363ca6d2dec1f62) or run `npx play-snake 20` to [play snake](https://www.npmjs.com/package/play-snake) in your terminal. 

When possible, my girlfriend, Victoria, our dog, Algot, and I often go
on trips with our self-built [camper van](https://www.instagram.com/jerrythevan/).
